            <h1 class="font-weight-bold">How to Play</h1><br>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Basics</h4>
            <p>Texas Hold'em is a variation of the popular card game "Poker", This tutorial will learn ya how to play everyone's favouite card game!<br><br>
                At the beginning of every game, each player is dealt two cards (known as the "Hole Cards"), from here each player either places
                their Bet, Checks or Folds.<br><br>
                Once every player has made their choice, the Dealer places three shared cards on the table (the "Flop"), 
                these are for the players to use at the end of the game. Following the initial Flop, players have another opportunity to Check, Raise or Fold;
                The dealer will add another card to the Flop, changing it to the "Middle". This process is repeated one last time, adding a final card to the middle
                in order to convert it into the "River".<br><br>
                Once the River has been established, any remaining players will be able to use these cards to supplement the ones that were dealt to them at the start of the game.
                The player with the strongest hands wins the amount of money raised by the players throughout the game.<br></p>
            <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Hand Variations</h4><br>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Highest Card</h5>
            <p> If no cards in any players hand form a pair AND there are no cards in the River that can provide a better; 
                The player with highest value card in their hand will win the prize pot.<br><br>
                Card values for reference (from lowest to highest): 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Pair</h5>
            <p>
                If you hold two cards of equal value, for instance: Two 10 cards, this will count as a pair. 
                Be aware that card value still takes priority in the event of a draw, for example: A pair of Queens will lose to a pair of Kings.
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Two Pairs</h5>
            <p>
                Having two pairs of different card values will put you at an advantage over a single pair, no matter how high their pair value is
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Three of a kind</h5>
            <p>
                Three or cards of the same value results in a "Three of a kind", For example: Three "Kings"
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Straight</h5>
            <p>
                If you have five cards in sequential order, this counts as a straight. This does not include cards of different suits.
                For example: 2-3-4-5-6
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Flush</h5>
            <p>
                Having five or more cards of the same suit results in a flush, the order of cards is not important for this hand. 
                An example hand would be Five Diamond cards.
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Full House</h5>
            <p>
                A full house consists of both a pair and three of a kind at the same time. For example: Two Jacks and three 5 cards.
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Four of a kind</h5>
            <p>
                Four cards of equal value results in a Four of a kind, this means one card from each suit, for example: four 3 cards.
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Straight Flush</h5>
            <p>
                A combination of the Straight and Flush hands, this involves both cards of the same suit in numerical sequence, For example:
                2-3-4-5-6 of diamonds. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Royal Flush</h5>
            <p>
                The big kahuna, the exodia, the one and only. A Royal Flush is the highest possible hand a player can have, regardless of suit,
                 the only combination of cards that can result in a Royal Flush is "10-Jack-Queen-King-Ace".
